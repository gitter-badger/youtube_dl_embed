<br> Want to embed youtube-dl,this is some of the ways I do it </br>
<br> 1.py </br>
<p>1. It starts to download the video mentioned in _url_,with ydl_opts as the parameter. </p>
<p>2. It will create a json file a.json which gets re written every time,you can use it to create a custom logger and display it</p>
<p> 3. The json is also printed in the terminal and cleared every time,so that you can see the realtime progress </p>
<p> 4. It will send a custom notification at 80 percent progress so that you can prepare the code, at 100 % or finished,a notification of 'file download ' will appear to notify you that the file has been downloaded </p>
